# 2021-podar-gathertax

Comparisons of protein and DNA grist done on SRR606249, the data set
from Shakya et al. 2013, lovingly named "podar".

---

These two notebooks generate the initial data frames with the taxonomic
info for protein and DNA, respectively:

* [gathergram-podar-protein](gathergram-podar-protein.ipynb)
* [gathergram-podar-dna](gathergram-podar-dna.ipynb)

This notebook compares the DNA and protein results:
